- 👋 Hi, I’m @bassopenguin
- 👀 I’m interested in Rust, Game Development, GraphQL, Software Architecture... lots of stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Game Development... _mostly those for now_
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust including Game Development engines/frameworks and general usage.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here?

Previous experience:
- Multi-threaded Java application for weather analysis/prediction (wayyyy back before Github was cool; _i.e., lost to time_)
- SAP Hybris storefront development (mostly data integration / transformation)
- Node.js + GraphQL + PostgreSQL experiments (i.e., how can we reduce waste in transactions? ask for what we want, use what we get)
- AWS technologies (S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, EC2, EMR, RDS, and Billing... Billing most of all: _turn off what you aren't using!_)
- Rust (if we can eliminate memory errors, I'm looking at you `NullPointerException`, how does that help our software?)

Currently working on:
- Using Rust for APIs
- Indie Game Development
